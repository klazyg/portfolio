This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# :framed_picture: Portfolio
I used Next.js technology and implemented various effects and hooks to increase interactivity on my Portfolio page. Thanks to a simple and clear interface, visitors can easily learn about my projects and skills, which allows for a more complete understanding of my profile as a Front-End Developer. To ensure that the page is displayed perfectly on different devices, I paid special attention to responsiveness.

## :gear: Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI, which allows you to clone, fork, and manage the repository directly from the command line. To clone the repository using GitHub CLI, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/portfolio
```
