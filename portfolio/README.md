This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# :framed_picture: Portfolio
I used Next.js technology and implemented various effects and hooks to increase interactivity on my Portfolio page. Thanks to a simple and clear interface, visitors can easily learn about my projects and skills, which allows for a more complete understanding of my profile as a Front-End Developer. To ensure that the page is displayed perfectly on different devices, I paid special attention to responsiveness.

## :gear: Running

After cloning the project repository, run the following command in the terminal to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, the project will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can also start editing the page by modifying the pages/index.tsx file. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub CLI interface to clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/portfolio
```
